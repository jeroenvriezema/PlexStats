PlexStats is a fork of the well known plexWatchWeb. It features all the same functions as plexWatchWeb, 
but there are some major changes comparing the two.

###Comparison between plexWatchWeb, and PlexStats
* Updated Bootstrap from version 2 to 3
* Added support for more languages
  * Translating aims to be really easy. All strings are stored within an XML file.
* Added theming support
  * Adding a theme is done by creating a .theme.css file to the themes folder.
  * 3 themes are available by default.
* Log-in support
  * As of now, only one user account is supported. In the next major release, multiple users will be supported.
* Wrote every code on each page as functions, stored in one single functions.php file.
